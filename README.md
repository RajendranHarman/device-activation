# Device Activation

Device Activation Component provides restful services for activating and reactivating devices like Dongle, HU, TCU and Dashcam; so that these devices can send data to the cloud post activation/reactivation.

## Getting Started

To build the project in the local working directory after the project has been cloned/forked, run:

```mvn clean install```

from the command line interface.

### Prerequisites

The list of tools required to build and run the project:
* Java 17
* Maven 3.8 or higher

### Installation

[Install Java 17](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&package=jdk#zulu)

[How to set up Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)


### Coding style check configuration

[checkstyle.xml](./checkstyle.xml) is the coding standard to follow while writing new/updating existing code.

Checkstyle plugin [maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.2.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) is integrated in [pom.xml](./pom.xml) which runs in the validate phase and check goal of the maven lifecycle and fails the build if there are any checkstyle errors in the project.

To run checkstyle plugin explicitly, run the following command: mvn checkstyle:check

### Running the tests

To run the tests for this system run the below maven command.

```mvn test```

Or run a specific test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheFirstUnitTest"```

To run a method from within a test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheSecondUnitTest#whenTestCase2_thenPrintTest2_1"```

### Deployment

The component can be deployed as a Kubernetes pod by installing Device factory management charts.
Link: [Charts](../../../ecsp-helm-charts/tree/main/device-auth)

Postgres DB needs to be installed and ignite database/schema should be created with the required tables.
Link of the database and table scripts to be installed: [dmpostgres.sql](https://github.com/eclipse-ecsp/ecsp-helm-charts/blob/main/postgresql/db-scripts/dmpostgres.sql)

## Usage

Device Activation microservice can be used to activate and reactivate devices like Dongle, HU, TCU and Dashcam; so that these devices can send data to the cloud post activation/reactivation.
Devices are activated and maintained in PostgreSQL DB with the Device State as ACTIVE/PROVISION_ALIVE (when device activation is called without performing device association; usually done if end user buys device only for internet connection) and Association Status would be ASSOCIATED after performing Device Association and Device Activation.
The end result of Device Activation/Reactivation is the generation of HarmanID/DeviceID and passcode which would be used by the devices to connect to the cloud.
